# Sudoku-Solver
This repository contains a C++ implementation of a Sudoku Solver using the backtracking algorithm.

##Description
The Sudoku Solver program solves Sudoku puzzles by filling in the empty cells of a 9x9 grid with digits from 1 to 9. The program uses a backtracking algorithm to ensure that each digit is placed according to Sudoku rules:

-Each digit must appear exactly once in each row.
-Each digit must appear exactly once in each column.
-Each digit must appear exactly once in each 3x3 subgrid.
##Features
-**Backtracking Algorithm**: Implements a backtracking approach to solve the Sudoku puzzle.
-**User Input**: Allows users to input their Sudoku grid with empty cells represented by zeroes.
-**Validation**: Validates input to ensure numbers are between 0 and 9.
